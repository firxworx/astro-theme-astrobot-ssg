Pages in `src/pages` can be authored in markdown (`*.md`) and MDX (`*.mdx`) thanks to the official mdx integration: `@astrojs/mdx`.

This page is an `.mdx` file that contains a mix of markdown and React components.

## Front Matter & Layout Selection

The layout for this page is set in the front matter using the reserved `layout` property.

Astro passes front matter data to layouts via props where the object is accessible via `Astro.props.frontmatter`.

## React Components

The following `ExampleComponent` is written in React and styled with tailwind. Its `import` statement is written after the front matter block and before the content.

The component is inserted into the content using standard JSX syntax: `<ExampleComponent .../>`:

<ExampleComponent className="max-w-sm mx-auto" />

The following `ExampleCounter` component is interactive. Try clicking the button to increment the counter.

<ExampleCounter client:load className="max-w-sm mx-auto" />

Astro's `client:load` directive is passed as a prop to `ExampleCounter`. This directive tells Astro to load the component on the client-side and hydrate it with its JavaScript so that interactivity works.

Astro's various `client:*` directives instruct Astro how and when to load the component's client-side JavaScript and enable interactivity.

## Markdown

Standard markdown syntax is ready to use including **bold**, _italic_, `code`, etc. thanks to tailwind's official typography plugin, `@tailwindcss/typography`.

This page's layout (`ProseLayout`) adds the plugin's `.prose` class to its main content container.

[Links](/about/) and bullet lists are styled for legibility:

- first item
- second item
- third item

Number lists appear as you expect:

1. hello
1. world

Tables are styled:

| Animal | Diet    |
| ------ | ------- |
| dog    | meat    |
| rabbit | veggies |
| budgie | seeds   |

Markdown code fence blocks feature syntax highlighting powered by shiki:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "hello world"
```

## TailwindCSS

Tailwind's utility classes can be used practically anywhere in this project including `*.md`, `*.mdx`, `*.astro`, and `*.tsx` files.

### Tailwind Classes

Here's an example of an element written inline this MDX content styled using tailwindcss:

<div class="flex h-10 w-10 rounded-full bg-slate-700 dark:bg-slate-600 justify-center items-center">
  <span>ðŸ˜Š</span>
</div>

And here's its code:

```html
<div class="flex h-10 w-10 rounded-full bg-slate-700 dark:bg-slate-600 justify-center items-center">
  <span>ðŸ˜Š</span>
</div>
```

### Line Lengths

If your site will include longer-form content you should ensure that lines of text are restricted to a maximum length per line.

Ensure that `max-w-prose` or a custom max-width such as `max-w-[80ch]` is applied to any elements that contain potentially-long text (or their relevant parents).

Tailwind's `max-w-prose` utility has a default value of `65ch`.

Recommendations for maximum line lengths vary however ranges between 45 and 90 characters are commonly cited. The <Link href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/styling/#:~:text=Line%20length">W3C advises</Link> that lines of text should not exceed 80 characters.
